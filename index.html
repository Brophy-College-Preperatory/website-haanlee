  <p> u may be wondering how does one toilet get so much power?!</p>
  
  <p> back in the day ppl viewed toilets as a way to get rid of their waste, and us toilets felt incredibly disrespected </p>
 
  <p> i decided that i wanted to kill humans and live in a world of toilets </p>
  <p>these "humans" that fight toilets have weird cameras on their heads</p>
  <p>they look kinda cyborgy</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <p> i have to give a shoutout to my accomplices, youtube, this journey and success would not be possible without youtubes addictive algorithm!</p>
  <p>if i got a dollar for everytime i ended up on someone's fyp i would be a billionaire rn</p>
  <p>although that is unfortunately not the case i do have 45 mil subs and have created an army of loyal followers</p>
  <p> even though i face major criticism from adults with brains, i am looking forward to the day when people look back on my videos with nostalgia </p>
  <p>the relationship between toilets and humans is kind of a love hate relationship because without humans toilets wouldnt have found the success they have rn but humans are the reasons toilets are rebbelling</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <p> i am arguably the most influential figure of the 21st century!</p>
  
  <p> i am so impactful in lives that people make songs about me </p>
  
  <p> to this day, i am constantly getting referred to by adolescents all over the planet </p>
  <p>once the amount of functioning toilets in the world overtake the human population toilets will dominate the earth</p>
 
  <p> my goal is to be the first real toilet on mars </p>
